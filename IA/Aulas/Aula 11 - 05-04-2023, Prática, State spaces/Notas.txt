state space of a problem <=> rules of the game

nodes in state space -> situations

arcs in the state space -> legal moves, or actions , or solution steps

A problem is defined by :

- a state space
- a start node
- a goal condition, goal nodes are the nodes that satisfy the condition

s(X,Y) -> represents a state space. It's true if there's a legal move in the state space from node X to Y.
