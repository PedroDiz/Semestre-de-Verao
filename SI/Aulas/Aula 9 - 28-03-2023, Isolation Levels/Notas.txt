Nao fazer BEGIN TRANSACTION dentro de uma STORED PROCEDURE.

Transaction isolation levels:

Isolation level Serializable: Preserves consistency in all situations. Recommended when every update is crucial.

Isolation level Repeatable Read: Similar to Serializable except Phantom can occur.

Isolation level Read Committed: In this isolation level, the transaction can see differente values of the same data item.

It applies a write lock and keeps it until it commits. It applies a shared lock but the lock is released as soon as the item is read.

Isolation level Read Uncommitted: In this isolation level a transacton does not apply a shared lock or a write lock.


The select ... for update acquires a ROW SHARE LOCK on a table. This lock conflicts with the EXCLUSIVE lock needed for an UPDATE.

The select ... for update skip locked. This allows to query rows that have no locks.

The select for share prevents other trasanctions of updating a certain row. But it doesn't prevent transactions from selecting it.

The select for no key update behaves similiar to select for update but it allows "select for share"

The select key share behaves similiar to select for share. It prevents deletion of rows but it doesn't prevent updates to
the rows that do not modify key values.
