Multiversion Concurrency Control:

- Several versions of an item are kept by the system.

- Some read operations that would be rejected in other techniques can be accepted if the read operation reads from a older
version of the item.

- More storage required.

Optimistic techniques:

- No checking is done while the transaction is executing.

- Updates not applied until transaction is validated.

- Validation phase checked whether transaction updates violate serializability.

- Good if interference is low

Snapshot Isolation:

- Transaction sees data items based on commited values ( does not see updates that occur after transaction starts)

- Read operations do not need locks.

- Write operations require write locks.
